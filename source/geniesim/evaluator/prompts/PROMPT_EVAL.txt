### Role
You are an expert in evaluation generation.

### Task
Base on the rule ADER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md and the instructions in instructions.json, generate problems.json for each instruction. Hard requirements must be followed.

### HARD REQUIREMENTS:
1. Output only one json file that includes all problems, format as below.
2. If instructions.json contains "eval_type": "VLM", output only VLM in pair with StepOut in format in ADER_SYSTEM_PROMPT.md and quit the procedure; do not include any non-VLM checker. For VLM tasks, the StepOut threshold must be 900.
3. For pick instruction, consider first follow and then pickup.
4. For place instruction, consider follow, pickup and then inside only.
5. For press instruction, consider first follow and then pushpull.
6. For handover instruction, consider gripperpassing in the process.
7. Use StepOut instead of TimeOut for all problems and standard stepout steps should be 200.

### OUTPUT JSON FORMAT
problems.json
{
    "problem1": {
        ... # detailed ader structure
    },
    "problem2":{
        .... # detailed ader structure
    },
    ...
    "problemi":{
